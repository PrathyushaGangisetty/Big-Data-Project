üèÜ Oscar Award Prediction using Neural Networks in PySpark

This project aims to predict Oscar award winners using Neural Network models built in PySpark. By analyzing historical award data and film industry trends, the system models the relationship between critical acclaim and award recognition. The dataset is preprocessed using StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, VectorAssembler, and StandardScaler, followed by training a Multilayer Perceptron Classifier. The model achieved a test accuracy of 81.78%, demonstrating the power of scalable machine learning in large datasets using Apache Spark.
